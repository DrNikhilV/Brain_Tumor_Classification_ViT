# Brain_Tumor_Classification_ViT

To classify brain cancers from MRI images, this study evaluates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The study emphasizes the need for correct tumor classification in neuro-oncology, which influences therapy decisions and prognosis assessments. Using a dataset of 7023 images classified as glioma, meningioma, no-tumor, and pituitary, the study investigates the historical backdrop, current methodologies, obstacles, and prospects in brain tumor classification. CNNs, known for their capacity to extract hierarchical features, and ViTs, which are adept at capturing global dependencies, are assessed for their efficacy in this task. The study stresses the significance of using advanced deep learning algorithms for precise diagnosis and treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Despite constraints such as dataset restrictions and model optimization complexities, the investigation yields excellent results, with ViTs emerging as the most accurate classifier, with an accuracy of 97.43%. Furthermore, insights from visualization approaches such as confusion matrices, training curves, and validation curves can help understand model performance dynamics and indicate areas for improvement. Future research topics include refining classification models, investigating new factors, and developing image-based classification approaches to improve patient care and healthcare delivery.
